# bin

A collection of utility scripts which I keep at ``~/bin``.

Some of these are mapped to keys for quick access in my build of ``dwm``. The
brightness and volume scripts are particularly useful in this context.

The ``,`` prefix is inspired by [Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes). It allows tab completion for
this set of scripts (since the `~/bin` directory is on my system `PATH`),
without having to type many characters to differentiate these scripts from
other programs.
