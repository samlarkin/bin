# bin

A collection of utility scripts which I keep at ``~/bin``.

Some of these are mapped to keys for quick access in my build of ``dwm``. The
brightness and volume scripts are particularly useful in this context.

The ``,`` prefix is inspired by Brandon Rhodes. It allows tab completion for
this set of scripts, since the ``~/bin`` directory is on my system ``PATH``.
